To run preliminary (unrelaxed) calculations at each multiplicity, and molecule in the molecule directory, execute run_energy_calc.sh

To relax the geometry for each molecule, run relax_molecules.sh

To restart the calculations for unfinished molecules, run submit unfinished.job to find which gemetries calculations are not complete, then restart_relaxation.sh to restart from the list generated.
